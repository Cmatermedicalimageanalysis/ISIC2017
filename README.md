This repository holds all the necessary codes for data preprocessing of the publicly available ISIC_2017 dataset and classification of them in 3 classes using deep convolutional neural network techniques.

The structure below shows the overall architecture of the Deep Feature Fusion Model fo Skin Lesion Classification Proposed by us.
The work has been accepted and presented at the 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computing and Applications,2024
